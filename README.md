# React Hands On Learning

I followed tutorial from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-first-react-js-application/learn/lecture/19089204?start=0#overview)

Learnt:

- Declarative UI with React - Once you know a declarative pattern, (swiftUI for mel), it's faster to pick up other declarative patterns like React, Vue, Flutter
- JSX - turns out it's simple and props are dynamic! Dynamic language & prototyping FTW, saves times
- React Router: but I spent 30 minutes debugging a misspelled route and wondering why my Axios didn't make the network call
- React hooks - simple extraction of common functionalities
- JS Destructuring
- TailwindCSS
