# React Hands On Learning

I followed tutorial from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-first-react-js-application/learn/lecture/19089204?start=0#overview)

Learnt:

- Declarative UI with React - Once you know a declarative pattern, (swiftUI for mel), it's faster to pick up other declarative patterns like React, Vue, Flutter
- JSX - turns out it's simple and props are dynamic! Dynamic language & prototyping FTW, saves times
- React Router: but I spent 30 minutes debugging a misspelled route and wondering why my Axios didn't make the network call
- React hooks - simple extraction of common functionalities
- JS Destructuring
- TailwindCSS


One thing where SwiftUI shines better than Web is not requiring wrappers similar to `<div>`s.

SwiftUI is also efficient and the views and it's modifications are lightweight.

However, in the Web world, I see lots of examples of wrapping with `<div>`s and this could cause issues.

Given the current state of popular web dev practices, Browsers might evolve to better handle the nested `<div>`s use case.
